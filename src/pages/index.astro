        <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl">What is SI?</h2>
        <p>
          Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a program that helps you understand
          your classes better. It's like a study group, but with a leader who
          knows the material well and can help you understand it better.
        </p>
        <p>
          SI sessions are generally catered to those that attend, so you can ask
          questions about the material, college life, or anything else you need
          help with. I've hosted sessions that covered everything from study
          tips, resume building, to how to make the most of your college
          experience.

          <p>
            Regular attendance of SI sessions improves students' understanding
            and success in classes, with an average of up to a full letter grade
            higher.

          <h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl">Group Learning</h2>
          <p>
            SI sessions provide a platform for students to collaborate, ask
            questions, share ideas, and learn from each other, making it a fun
            and interactive learning experience.
