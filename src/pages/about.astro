        Hi! My name is Joel and I'm a junior studying Computer Science at CSUF!
        I've been an SI Leader for the past year and have loved every minute of
        it. I've helped students understand their classes better, improve their
        grades, and make the most of their college experience. I'm excited to
        help you succeed too!

    <p>
      Outside of SI, I enjoy coding, playing video games, and spending time with
      my girlfriend and friends. I'm the current president of ACM at CSUF and
      have been a part of the club for the past two years.
